This is the code repository for the GCP (Google Cloud Platform) adaptation of the scripts you can find in the book [The Road to Azure Cost Governance ](https://www.packtpub.com/product/the-road-to-azure-cost-governance/9781803246444?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=), published by Packt.

**Techniques to tame your monthly GCP bill with a continuous optimization journey for your apps**

## What is this book about?
Cloud teams and ICT cost controllers working with Azure will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide, introducing a process model for structured cost governance. The Road to Azure Cost Governance is a must-read if you find yourself facing the harsh reality of monthly cloud costs gradually getting out of control.
Starting with how resources are created and managed, everything you need to know in order to track, display, optimize, rightsize, and clean up cloud resources will be tackled with a workflow approach that will leave the choice of operation to you (be it the Azure CLI, automation, logic apps, or even custom code). Using real-world datasets, you'll learn everything from basic cost management to modeling your cloud spend across your technical resources in a sustainable way. The book will also show you how to create a recursive optimization process that will give you full control of spending and savings, while helping you reserve budget for future cloud projects and innovation.

## Not all clouds are created equals
Public cloud enviroments have different terms, services and characteristics, but have some common concept too.
This repository allows you to use the concepts and the reports of "The Road to Azure Cost Governance" to Google Cloud Platform (aka GCP).

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. 
Script to ingest costs and build reports are in Chapter03 and Chapter05, respectively.
In this repository you will find the porting of the original scripts of the book, to support the same analysis for Google Cloud Platform.

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If youâ€™re someone who deals with Google cloud costs and has a technical background, these scripts will help you understand and control your cloud spending.
